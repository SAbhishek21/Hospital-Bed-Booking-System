# Hospital-Bed-Slot-Booking-System

This is my Project on COVID Hospital Bed Slot Booking system. As we all remember the crisis of the COVID hospital Beds during the 2nd wave of COVID, so seeing the situation an idea struck my mind to make a web based application which takes the details of the available beds from the Hospital users and the same details will be displayed to the patient when he logins to the website ,and from there he can also book the bed slot and type of beds which he wants from the available ones, this will be directly linked to the database of the Hospital.

Working: In this Web-App, first the administrator can login and can the add the hospital code and some other minimal description , and then the authorization ID and Password will be sent directly to their Mail through the Flask-Mail feature. These authorization details can be used by the hospital staff to login to our web app and add their Bed availability details along with the type of BEDS(Normal, ICU, Oxygen etc..) then finally the patients can login to the page and book the hospital bed slot according to their preference.
